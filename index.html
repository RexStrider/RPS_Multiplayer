        * Create a game that suits this user story:

        * Only two users can play at the same time.

        * Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.

        * The game will track each player's wins and losses.

        * Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.

        * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

        * Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.
