It's the game Rock Paper Scissors, but it's multiplayer!

Crrently the way the game works is that the player enters their name.

On entering their name, the player may then pick a choice.

 * rock
 * paper
 * scissors

Once a choice is picked the player waits around for another player to join in, giving themselves a name and picking a choice.

This can be simulated by opening another window and repeating the same process.

At the moment the applications only supports two players at a time.

I have plans to put in a queue and chat system for bystanders.
